    <p id="comfort">Reading: Folding Beijing by Hao Jingfang</p>


    <p id="comfort">The novel mainly illustrates a future that Beijing is divided by three different spaces, in which people have totally different time, space, lifestyle and perception. </p>

    <p id="comfort">I love this book because it reflects the huge gap and differences between different social hierarchy. The novel uses the experience of the main character to show the social codition and social issues in China. For example, in the story, the main character needs to spend large amounts of money for his daughter to go to a kindergarten. Parents have to pay for opportunities for their children's future. Money is almost the ultimate factor and a motivation for people's behavior, which is why the student in Second Space chose to go to the bank. </p>

    <p id="comfort">In this story, there is no villain. Everyone is normal and has their own problems in their lives, following their own desires. They are not perfect, but makes me feel real. However, just because of this sense of reality, I feel this world so cruel that even the time is not equal to everyone. I really like the way that Jingfang illustrated to show these problems we face every day, not only the huge gap between people's economic level, but also the inequality of education, resources, environment and mental issues such as anxiety. </p>
