    <p id="comfort">Reading: Extrapolation Factory Operator's Manual, Visionary Fiction by Walidah Imarisha, Fergusson is the Future</p>

    <p id="comfort">In Visionary Fiction, Walidah Imarisha defined visionary fiction as a kind of Apocalyptic literature including many other types of fiction. There is no definitive answer to the future. I agree with her opinion that "everything that can happen has and is happening". According to her, the visionary fiction is different from mainstream science fiction, which replicated the power inequalities of this world and grafts them onto the future. </p>

    <p id="comfort">The Extrapolation Factory gives me a great example for my zines and how to use different methods to develop my speculative world. For example, in the reading, it mentions the term bisociation, defining it as "the inherent multivalent or multiplanar nature of the creative art". And it gives an example of how students might use it to imagine new mobile devices. I think this explanation gives me much inspiration in how to build my own world, as well as methods such as the future wheel map and persona. </p>
